## Notes
During this meeting, the outreach committee reviewed the Committee Goals document. It was brought that the TARS social media channels should increase content input from the community by building a workflow for community members to submit their content. In addition, another focus of TARS outreach to increase visibility of TARS is to host community meetups, and updates about the online meetup were provided to the members. We are exploring more opportunities to collaborate organizations or companies to host more targeted meetup in the next year. 
The nomination phase of chairperson election has started since March 19th and will end on April 2. 

## Action Items
