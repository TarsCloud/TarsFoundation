## Notes
The purpose of this meeting was onboarding the committee members with the TARS Foundation’s digital marketing scheme and programs. It was advised by committee members to set quantifiable/ concrete goals when growing TARS’ social media audience outside of China. 
Additionally, the TARS Foundation is working to host online meetups targeting audiences in Canada and India. If you are interested in becoming a speaker for TARS events, please let Paige know (email: paige@tarscloud.org)
