# The TARS Foundation Contributor Guide
The TARS Foundation provides a platform for developers who are interested in contributing to an open source project. We not only extends different opportunities for developers to contribute to open source projects, but also the possibility to take on leadership roles and create major contributions in the broader open source community. 

There are the roles of **Contributor**, **Committer**, **Maintainer**, and **Ambassador** in our open source ecosystem, each having different requirements and responsibilities. 

## Contributor
To get involved with TARS open source projects, you can first become a Contributor by participating in software construction and having at least one pull request merged into the source code. 

There are several ways for software developers to engage with the TARS community and become contributors:
- Help other users and answer questions.
- Submit meaningful issues.
- Use TARS projects in production to increase testing scenarios.
- Improve technical documentations.
- Publish articles on applications and case studies related to TARS projects.
- Report or repair the bugs found in TARS software.
- Write source code analysis or annotate. 
- Submit your pull request.

Follow the below steps to submit your pull request:
- Fork the project from the Tars repository to your GitHub account.
- Git clone the repository to your local machine.
- Create a sub-branch.
- Make changes to the code and test it on your local machine.
- Commit those changes.
- Push the committed code to GitHub.
- Open a new pull request to submit your changes for review.
- Your changes will be merged into the master branch if accepted.

## Committer
A Committer is a contributor who has made distinct contributions to the TARS repositories and has accomplished at least one essential construction project or has repaired critical bugs. He or she can also take on some leadership opportunities.

A Committer is expected to:
- Display excellent ability to make technical decisions.
- Have successfully submitted and merged 5 pull requests.
- Have contributed to the improvement of project code quality and performance.
- Have implemented significant features or fixed major bugs.

After meeting the above requirements, you can submit a Committer request:
  - STEP 1: Provide your proofs of the above criteria under Repo ISSUE.
  - STEP 2: Submit your pull request after you receive a response with instructions
  - STEP 3: Once your application is accepted, you will become a TARS Committer.


As a Committer, you are able to:
- Oversee the code quality.
- Respond to the pull requests submitted by the community.
- Mentor contributors to promote collaborations in the open source community.
- Attend regular meetings for committers. 
- Know about project updates and trends in advance.


## Maintainer
Maintainers are responsible for devising the subprojects in the TARS community, and they will take the lead to make decisions associated with project development, while holding the power to merge branches. They should demonstrate excellent judgment and sense of responsibility for the well-being of subprojects, as they need to define or approve design strategies suitable for developing subprojects 

A Maintainer is expected to:
- Have a strong grasp of TARS technology.
- Be proactive to organize technical seminars and put forward construction projects.
- Be able to handle more complicated problems in coding.
- Get unanimously approved by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

As a Maintainer, you have the right to:
- Devise and decide the technical top-level design of subprojects.
- Define the technical direction and priority of sub-projects.
- Participate in version releases and ensure code quality.
- Guide Contributors and Committers to promote collaborations in the open source community.

## Ambassador
Passionate about open source technology and community, Ambassadors promote and support an extensive use of TARS technology to a wider audience of software developers. Ambassadors’ expertise and involvement in TARS projects will also acquire you greater recognition in the community.

An Ambassador is able to:
- Become a general member of TARS Foundation.
- Participate in TARS Foundation’s projects as a contributor, lecturer, or blogger.
- Engage with developers by presenting at community events or sharing technology articles on online media platforms.


# Looking Forward
Ultimately, the TARS Foundation encourages outstanding contributors to join the governing board and the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). At this level, you will focus on the strategic directions and decision making of the organization as a whole.
